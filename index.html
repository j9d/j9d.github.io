            <h2>who?</h2>
            <p>Hello!</p>
            <p>I'm a Melbourne-based software engineer working at <a href="https://www.wsp.com/en-au/hubs/digital-solutions">WSP Digital</a>, a software consultancy. I currently work with Django and React.</p>

            <h2>tech stack</h2>
            <p>Day-to-day I work with Python and TypeScript, using Django and React respectively. On the infrastructure side, I'm learning the ins and outs of Docker and AWS CDK.</p>
            <p>We are firmly integrated with AWS, and I'm fairly comfortable working with it. So far I've obtained an AWS Certified Developer (Associate) certificate, to make that comfort a bit more official.</p>
            <p>I'm also vaguely familiar with Java and C++, having used them in the past at university.</p>

            <h2>hobbies</h2>
            <p>Outside of work I mostly play games, read, or <a href="https://wiby.me">surf the old web</a>.</p>
            <p>I thoroughly enjoy snowboarding, and go bouldering with my mates every so often.</p>
            <p>I also occasionally take <a href="photography.html">photos</a>.</p>
