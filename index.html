                <p>Hello!</p>
                <p>
                    I'm a Melbourne-based software engineer working at
                    <a href="https://www.wsp.com/en-au/hubs/digital-solutions">WSP Digital</a>, a software consultancy.
                    I currently work with Django and React.

                <p>
                    Day-to-day I work with Python and TypeScript, using Django and React respectively. On the
                    infrastructure side, I'm learning the ins and outs of Docker and AWS CDK.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm fairly comfortable working with AWS, and I've obtained an AWS Certified Developer (Associate)
                    certificate. Currently I'm looking into learning the Azure ecosystem, too.
                </p>
                <p>I'm also vaguely familiar with Java and C++, having used them in the past at university.</p>

                <h2>hobbies</h2>
                <p>
                    Outside of work I mostly play games, read, or
                    <a href="https://wiby.me" target="_blank">surf the old web</a>.
                </p>
                <p>I thoroughly enjoy snowboarding, and go bouldering with my mates regularly.</p>
                <p>I also occasionally take <a href="photography.html">photos</a>.</p>
