            <h2>who?</h2>
            <p>Hello!</p>
            <p>I'm a Melbourne-based software developer who currently works at <a href="https://www.wsp.com/en-au/hubs/digital-solutions">WSP Digital</a>, a software consultancy. I currently work almost exclusively with Django and Vue.</p>
            <p>As you could probably tell by looking at this site, I enjoy <a href="https://motherfuckingwebsite.com">efficient website design</a>.</p>

            <h2>tech stack</h2>
            <p>I currently work with both Django (Python) and Vue, though I vastly prefer and consider myself a backend developer.</p>
            <p>We are firmly integrated with AWS, and I'm pretty comfortable working with it. At the moment I'm working on obtaining one or two AWS Certifications to make that comfort a bit more official.</p>

            <h2>hobbies</h2>
            <p>I game a bunch. Mostly shooters (RIP Titanfall), Minecraft, or whichever popular third-person AAA game has most recently released, be it God of War or Horizon.</p>
            <p>I thoroughly enjoy snowboarding and head up the slopes a few times per year. It's pretty taxing on the ol' bank account, though. :(</p>
            <p>I regularly cycle around Melbourne with my co-workers. At our current rate, we aim to sample every hot chip shop in the city over the next 3 years.</p>
            <p>I also occasionally take <a href="photography.html">photos</a>.</p>
