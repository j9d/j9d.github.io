            <p>I quite enjoy astrophotography and night photography.</p>
            <p>My gear:
                <ul>
                    <li>Canon 5D mk II</li>
                    <li>Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 STM</li>
                    <li>Canon EF 24-85mm f/3.5-4.5 USM</li>
                </ul>

            <p>some photos i took late at night in the middle of nowhere.</p>

                <img src="https://d15vtlk1fld2r.cloudfront.net/0961-web-small.jpg">
                <p class="img-info">Probably the first image that I've been honestly proud of. Sadly I couldn't expose for any longer than 20 minutes, as my lens started fogging up afterwards. Next time I'll also find a spot away from a major truck route, I'm lucky their headlights didn't <em>completely</em> blow out the bottom corner.</p>

            <div class="photo-section img-right">
                <p class="img-info">I quite like the dawn-y look of this, even though it was taken in complete darkness. makes me think about how surreal it would be to wake up to a scene like this in the morning.</p>

                <p class="img-info">One of many images that makes me want a star tracker, since things start to get blurry at exposures of about 30 seconds. Even this image is if you zoom in far enough. I can't imagine what I could capture without needing to worry about the sky rotating.</p>
