                <ul>
                    <li>canon 5d mk ii</li>

            <p>some photos i took late at night in the middle of nowhere.</p>

                <img src="https://d15vtlk1fld2r.cloudfront.net/0961-web.jpg" class="feature-img">
                <p class="img-info">probably the first image that i've been really proud of. sadly i couldn't expose for any longer than 20 minutes, as my lens started fogging up afterwards. next time i'll also find a spot away from a major truck route, i'm lucky their headlights didn't <em>completely</em> blow out the bottom corner.</p>

            <div class="mini-section img-right">
                <p class="img-info">i really like the dawn-y look of this, even though it was taken in complete darkness. makes me think about how surreal it would be to wake up to a scene like this in the morning.</p>

                <p class="img-info">one of many images that makes me want a star tracker, since things start to get blurry at exposures of about 30 seconds. even this image is, once you zoom in. i can't imagine what i could capture without needing to worry about the sky rotating.</p>
