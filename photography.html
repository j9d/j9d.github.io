                <p>some photos i took late at night in the middle of nowhere.</p>

                        Probably the first image that I've been honestly proud of. Sadly I couldn't expose for any
                        longer than 20 minutes, as my lens started fogging up afterwards. Next time I'll also find a
                        spot away from a major truck route, I'm lucky their headlights didn't <em>completely</em> blow
                        out the bottom corner.

                        I quite like the dawn-y look of this, even though it was taken in complete darkness. makes me
                        think about how surreal it would be to wake up to a scene like this in the morning.

                        One of many images that makes me want a star tracker, since things start to get blurry at
                        exposures of about 30 seconds. Even this image is if you zoom in far enough. I can't imagine
                        what I could capture without needing to worry about the sky rotating.
